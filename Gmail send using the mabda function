Workflow
Rule Trigger:

The EventBridge Rule (CDDailyTrigger) triggers at 00:30 UTC daily based on the cron expression.
Targeted Lambda:

The rule targets a Lambda function, identified by its ARN (LambdaTargetArn).
Lambda Execution:

The input payload (JSON) is sent to the Lambda function.
The Lambda function processes this payload:
Makes a POST request to the provided URL.
Adds headers like userId (from RootUserId) and Content-Type.
API Call:

The Lambda function sends an HTTP POST request to the endpoint (TargetApp) /api/v1/system/update-users-information.
Email Sending:

The backend API (update-users-information) presumably processes the data and sends an email to users. This might include:
Fetching user details from a database.
Using an email service like SES (Simple Email Service) or a third-party API.
