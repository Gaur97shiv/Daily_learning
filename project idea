                                                       TECHNICAL ROADMAP

Here’s a detailed technical roadmap to guide your development process for Annadata, starting with backend essentials, setting up the database schema, then moving to frontend and API integrations.

1. Phase 1: Backend Setup and Database Schema Design
Objective: Establish a solid backend foundation and design the database schema to support essential functionalities.

Database Schema Design (SQL):

Start here by designing tables for core entities: Farmer, Contractor, Contract, MandiRates, SoilHealth, GovernmentSchemes, UserRoles, etc.
Define relationships between tables (e.g., a one-to-many relationship between Farmer and Contracts, Contractor and Contracts).
Normalize your schema to reduce redundancy and improve data consistency. You can add additional tables for Regions, CropTypes, and SoilData as reference tables.
Consider how you’ll store multilingual data (for example, by using localized text tables or language codes for UI elements).
Backend APIs (Spring Boot):

Start setting up basic API endpoints with Spring Boot for user authentication (signup/login), profile management, and CRUD operations for each core entity (Farmer, Contractor, Contracts).
Implement JWT authentication for secure login.
Database Connection: Use JPA/Hibernate to manage data flow and establish connections to the SQL database.
Outcome: A fully functioning backend with foundational data structures and APIs for frontend to interact with.

2. Phase 2: Frontend Core Setup and Basic Pages
