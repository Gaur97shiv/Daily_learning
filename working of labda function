How Lambda Functions Work
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that executes your code in response to events like an API Gateway request, DynamoDB stream, or in your case, a CloudWatch Event (EventBridge Rule).

How to Connect Lambda to a CloudWatch Event
CloudWatch Rule:

A CloudWatch Event Rule (now EventBridge Rule) is configured to trigger based on a schedule or specific events.
The rule specifies the Lambda function as its target using the Lambda's ARN.
IAM Role:

Ensure the Lambda function's execution role includes permissions for:
Logging to CloudWatch Logs.
Any other AWS services the function needs to interact with.
Lambda Function Execution:

When triggered, AWS Lambda executes your function code using the payload provided by the rule.
Where to Find the Lambda Function
You can manage Lambda functions using the following tools:

1. AWS Management Console:
Navigate to AWS Console → Lambda service.
You’ll see all deployed Lambda functions listed. You can view, edit, and configure them here.
2. VS Code with AWS Toolkit:
Install the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.
This lets you browse AWS resources (including Lambda functions) directly in VS Code.
Steps:
Open the AWS Toolkit in VS Code.
Configure credentials.
Navigate to the Lambda section to see existing functions.
3. Local Code Repository:
If you or your team wrote the function, check your repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, or local files).
The Lambda function is typically defined as a .js, .py, or .java file.
Sample Lambda Function (Node.js)
Here’s a sample file for a Lambda function to process the event and send an HTTP POST request:

javascript
Copy code
const https = require('https');

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    console.log("Received event:", JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));

    // Extract URL and headers from the event input
    const { method, url, headers, body } = event;

    // Prepare options for the HTTP request
    const options = {
        method: method || 'POST',
        headers: headers.reduce((acc, { name, value }) => {
            acc[name] = value;
            return acc;
        }, {}),
    };

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const req = https.request(url, options, (res) => {
            let responseBody = '';
            res.on('data', (chunk) => responseBody += chunk);
            res.on('end', () => {
                console.log("Response:", responseBody);
                resolve({
                    statusCode: res.statusCode,
                    body: responseBody
                });
            });
        });

        req.on('error', (err) => {
            console.error("Error:", err);
            reject(err);
        });

        // Send request body
        if (body) {
            req.write(body);
        }

        req.end();
    });
};
How to Frame the Lambda Function
Event Input:

The event is passed from CloudWatch. Your function should handle this input and extract relevant data.
Dependencies:

Include libraries like https for HTTP calls or aws-sdk for interacting with AWS services.
Testing Locally:

Install AWS SAM CLI or use AWS Toolkit in VS Code.
Use a mock event JSON file to test locally before deploying.
Deploying to AWS:

Use AWS CLI, SAM CLI, or the AWS Management Console to upload the function code.
Example CLI command:
bash
Copy code
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name MyFunction --zip-file fileb://function.zip
Mock Event for Testing
json
Copy code
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "http://example.com/api/v1/system/update-users-information",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "userId", "value": "root-user-id" },
    { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" }
  ],
  "body": "{\"key\": \"value\"}"
}
